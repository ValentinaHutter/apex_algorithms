title: APEx Algorithm Catalogue
---

 The [APEx Algorithm Catalogue](https://algorithm-catalogue.apex.esa.int/) is a valuable and innovative resource that grants access to a wide array of high-quality EO services. It serves as a central hub for users to discover EO services tailored to their specific requirements. For EO projects, this catalogue provides an intuitive and reliable platform to showcase and offer their services to a broader community, thereby fostering collaboration and enhancing the utilization of their results.
 
All algorithms registered in this repository are seamlessly integrated and visualized within the APEx Algorithm Catalogue. This integration relies on properties defined in the OGC API Records stored in a JSON format. The information gleaned from the OGC API Records is instrumental in constructing both the overview of the catalogue and the detailed pages of each service.

This page will delve deeper into the setup and operations of this integration, providing further insights into how users can benefit from the services offered.

# Getting Started

::: {.callout-note}
Before you begin, ensure your algorithm is hosted on an APEx-compliant platform. If you need assistance in selecting a suitable platform, refer to the [APEx Hosting Platform Onboarding Support](https://esa-apex.github.io/apex_documentation/propagation/onboarding.html#hosting-platform-onboarding-support) section.
:::

Onboarding your service to the APEx Algorithm Catalogue is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Create a new branch based on the `main` branch of the [APEx Algorithm Repo](https://github.com/ESA-APEx/apex_algorithms). Please create a new branch on the main repository to ensure you can leverage the preview capabilities within the PR.
2. Start by creating an OGC API Record for your algorithm. You can use one of the existing records in the repository as a template to guide you. Make sure to fill in all the required fields and provide accurate information about your service. More details about the record structure can be found in the [Record Mapping](#record-mapping) section below. Please note the service ID that you have used to identify your record.
3. Add your record file to `algorithm_catalog/<provider>/<service_id>/records/<service_id>.json`. You can create the necessary subdirectories if they do not already exist.
4. If this is your first record as a new provider, please ensure that the corresponding [provider record](#creating-a-new-provider-record) is created.
5. If your service is introducing a new platform, please create the corresponding [platform record](#creating-a-new-platform-record).
6. Once your record is ready, submit a pull request to this repository. The APEx team will review your submission and, upon approval, your service will be added to the APEx Algorithm Catalogue.

# Providers and Platforms

To ensure the proper contribution of the services that are part of the APEx Algorithm Catalogue, it is essential to include information about the service provider and the hosting platform within the record. 

## Provider Information

### Creating a new Provider Record
If you are creating a new folder in the `algorithm_catalog` directory for your service, make sure to include a `record.json` file within that folder. This OGC API Record should contain all the necessary information about the service provider, such as the provider's name, description, and contact details, and a link to the website and logo. You can refer to an existing provider folder in the repository as a template for creating your own.

Each provider record must also have an `properties.acl` section that defines the access control list for the services of this provider. This information is used to determine which email addresses are authorized to access benchmark information for services hosted on that platform. You can either specify specific email addresses or define email domains that are allowed access.

### Linking the Service to the Provider
It is also important to link the service record to the provider record. This can be achieved by adding an entry in the `links` section of the service record, where the `rel` property is set to `provider` and the  `href` contains the relative path to the provider's record file (`../../record.json`).

## Hosting Platform Information

### Creating a new Platform Record
If you are integrating a service record that is hosted on an APEx-compliant platform that is not yet represented in the repository, you will need to create a new `<platform>.json` file within the `platform_catalog` directory. This new file contains all the necessary information about the hosting platform, such as its name, description, contact details, website link, and logo. You can refer to an existing platform file in the repository as a template for creating your own.

### Linking the Service to the Hosting Platform
To link the service record to the hosting platform record, add an entry in the `links` section of the service record. Set the `rel` property to `platform` and the `href` to the relative path of the platform's record file (`../../../../platform_catalog/<platform>.json`).

# Record Mapping
The following sections demonstrate how the various sections from the record are connected to the information displayed in the APEx Algorithm Service Catalogue.

## Service Visibility

In those cases where the service is not intended to be publicly available, the `properties.visibility` property in the record can be set to `private`. This ensures that the service will not be listed in the [APEx Algorithm Catalogue](https://algorithm-catalogue.apex.esa.int/). The default value for this property is `public`, meaning that if it is not specified, the service will be visible in the catalogue.

## Services Overview

@tbl-overview-mapping illustrates how the various sections from the record are connected to the general overview of all the services in the APEx Service Catalogue as shown in @fig-overview.

| Component | Description | Record Property |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Header | Header image of the service card | Entry in `properties.links` where `rel` is equal to `thumbnail`. If not available, a default image will be shown. |
| Type | Type of the service | Determined based on the value of the `confirmsTo` field. |
| Title | Title of the service card | `properties.title` |

## FAQ

### How can I execute the unit tests locally?

Whenever you push changes to the remote repository in a pull request (PR), automated tests are executed to verify whether the provided records comply with the expected schemas.

However, it can sometimes be useful to run these tests locally first. This allows you to iterate more quickly and makes debugging easier.

To run the tests locally, execute the `test_records.py` test file by following these steps:

1. **Create a Python environment.** It is recommended to use a virtual environment or a Conda environment to isolate dependencies. For example:

```shell
conda create --name apex_algorithms_qa python pytest
conda activate apex_algorithms_qa
```
2. **Install the APEx QA toolbox** by running:
```shell
pip install qa/tools
```
3. **Run the tests** using:
```shell
pytest qa/unittests/tests/test_records.py
```

### The record validation fails because of the keywords I used. What can I do?

To ensure consistency across the [APEx Algorithm Catalogue](https://algorithm-catalogue.apex.esa.int/), APEx restricts the set of keywords that can be used. If the current list does not include keywords relevant to your service, the list can be extended through a pull request (PR).

However, **all keywords must match the [EarthData taxonomy](https://gcmd.earthdata.nasa.gov/KeywordViewer)**. Any keyword you add must already exist in this taxonomy to be accepted by APEx.

To add a new keyword, include it in the `keywords` section of the `schemas/record.json` file.
