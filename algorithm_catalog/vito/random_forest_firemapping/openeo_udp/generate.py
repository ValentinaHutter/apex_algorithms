This service is build upon techniques described in the research paper by Zhou, Bao et al., which introduces a machine learning–based approach using Sentinel-2 imagery. Their method combines spectral, topographic, and textural features to improve classification accuracy, particularly emphasising GLCM texture features extracted from Sentinel-2's short-wave infrared band.Thus, the UDP performs forest fire mapping using a pre-trained Random Forest model in openEO. It combines Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 features, applies the model, and outputs the predicted fire mapping results.",
